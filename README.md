# Knights vs Demons

## Description
Knights vs Demons is a turn-based C++ game in which an armored knight must defend a castle from invading demons. The objective is to prevent the demons from breaching the castle defenses and assassinating the king, which would result in the fall of the kingdom.

The player progresses through multiple rounds of combat, carefully managing health, resources, and strategic decisions to survive increasingly difficult encounters. After defeating all demon waves, the player must face a powerful demon boss as the final challenge.

The game emphasizes combat strategy, resource management, and progressive difficulty.
